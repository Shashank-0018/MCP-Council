# MCP-Council Ideation Report 

## Section: Phase Distribution of the Project and scopes

### Phase 1:

We will create a simple MVP of MCP-Council that will take the inputs from the users about the different endpoints and will  store them and create a record of tools and their endpoints.

Each endpoint will have a unique id and will be stored in a database.
The user will be able to add, update, delete and view the endpoints.
Each Tool will be associated with an endpoint.

For MVP Phase 1 we will use a public api endpoint

### Phase 2:

We will add the option for the authenticated endpoints

### Phase 3:

We will start customising our platform by adding concept of 'credits' each credit will be equivalent to 1 MCP Tool created

### Phase 4:

We will add the option for the users to create their own APIs as well as Tools
